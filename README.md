# Cracking the Code to a Good Nightâ€™s Sleep

This project uses multiple linear regression to model the relationship between sleep efficiency and several predictor variables in R.

## Key Feautures 

- Feature engineering: Determines optimal power transformations for the data using inverse response plots and the Box-Cox method
- Feature Selection: Applies forward and backward stepwise variable selection to counteract model symptoms related to multicollinearity and select the best predictive sleep efficiency model
- Model Building: Develops multiple linear regression models
- Visualization: Plots diagnostics to check regression model assumptions
 
## Contents

- data/: Folder containing the World Bank datasets
- carbon_dioxide_emissions_forecasting.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all code for analysis, model building, and visualization
